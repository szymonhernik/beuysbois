It lands the subject of an archive as a political cause – shaping discourses, securing power and authority as well as administering societies and gathering/governing knowledge. The prerogative of the beuys bois archive is its link to the local community. We have launched an <span class="italic highlight">OPEN CALL</span> for queer stories in order to reflect the needs, desires, fears and obstacles present in our closest proximity.
