It inhabits physical, virtual and conceptual space at the core of beuys bois.  Its content, drawing from existing counterparts in the Netherlands and beyond, is primarily powered by Queer living as it exists in daily experiences that surpass border divisions. Despite the potentially passive connotations that archives hold, our archive is a shapeshifter -  it remains open for change so it can be re-formed when the possibility arrives.

          <span>In <span class="italic highlight">beuys bois</span> we are aware that past decisions are reflected in today’s inequalities, struggles and dominances. It lands the subject of an archive as a political cause – shaping discourses, securing power and authority as well as administering societies and gathering/governing knowledge. The prerogative of the beuys bois archive is its link to the local community. We have launched an <a href="open-call.html"><span class="link italic highlight">OPEN CALL</span></a> for queer stories in order to reflect the needs, desires, fears and obstacles present in our closest proximity.
