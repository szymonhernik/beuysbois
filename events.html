          </div>
          <p>beuys bois headquarters are located in a building that is also a home to multiple organizations and individuals. As the newbies in the neighbourhood we felt strongly about introducing ourselves and our mission to the locals. We initiated a gathering on a rainy summer afternoon in the adjacent garden that allowed us to connect with the environment we now inhabit and the people that make it. We shared coffee, bread, and stories, paving the way for new relationships between members of beuys bois and our neighbours.</p>

          <p>
            The idea for beuys bois merchandise was born organically out of passion for clothing, especially the way in which it operates as a form of  embodied self-expression. As a new initiative with strong visual identity we searched for ways to create unique pieces that both reflect our mission and can serve as daily go-to garments. In June, 2020, we have organized a photoshoot of the upcycled/recycled pieces we’ve been working on the past months. Hosted in our headquarters, the photoshoot turned into a queer gathering which served as a sketch of what the future of beuys bois can bring. <br /><br />
            We would like to thank all the participating models for their time and beautiful work. <br /><br />

            Models: Nara Winston, Aya Koné, Daniel Walton, Toto Stoffels, Siadhail Augusteijn, Jacky Tang<br />
            Styling, Clothes, Set Design: beuys bois<br />
            Photographer: Kexin Hao<br /><br />

            The selling of the merch aims at helping us become a foundation. We aim at continuing work on merchandise editions as a way to explore different identities and help us sustain our organization.
